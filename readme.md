##Worldwide Endemic Mammal Species
**By Hannah Wright**
<p> This project is a depiction of the worldwide amount of endemic mammal species by country, endemic refferring to species that are native and restricted to that country. I chose to display the data using a graduated circle map where the lowest number of endemic species (0) corresponds to the smallest circles you can see on the map in countries like Greenland and France. I made sure to include a descriptive title and I chose a base map that labeled countries and allowed for my circles to stand out. I placed the text description of the map in the bottom left corner, and I included my name and data source at the bottom. </p>
